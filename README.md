Projet de Gabriel Calmel et Caroline Bourdet

[CORRECTION GPIO] (Don't hesitate to remove this part)
I couldn't compile ! When you build your project for the first time, I recommand you to use the ```cargo new your_project``` command.
Consider subdividing your project into separate modules.
You could abstract your function more, by putting your register adress out of the function.
Any operations here will be limited to the I/O registers of port B.
